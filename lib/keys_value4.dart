// It turns out that when we use UniqueKey, by clicking the button, the TextField gets cleared of all of its text, while it is not the case for ValueKey.
// The reason is that when TextField is rebuilt, a new UniqueKey is created and it is completely different from the old TextFieldâ€™s one. As a result, the TextField Element cannot find matched TextField Widget so it is disposed of and re-created which leads to losing all of our text.
